This website is a community-based Lost and Found platform where users can report and browse lost or found items.The platform is built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and supports OTP-based verification via KIIT mail. Images are uploaded and stored using Cloudinary integration. The UI is enhanced with Tailwind CSS and react-toastify for responsive design and real-time user feedback.
